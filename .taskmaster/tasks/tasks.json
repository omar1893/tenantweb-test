Implement a billing address section with a checkbox labeled 'Billing address is not in the United States'. Use Ionic components for form inputs to ensure consistency and responsiveness.\n3. Develop payment method selection using Ionic buttons for Apple Pay, Google Pay, and credit card options. Integrate Capacitor plugins for handling Apple Pay and Google Pay transactions.\n4. Add an order summary section that dynamically displays a breakdown of charges and the total amount. Use Vue's reactivity to update this section based on user input.\n5. Include legal text with links to the Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, and Cancellation Policy. Ensure links open in a new browser tab or modal.\n6. Implement a confirmation button that remains disabled until all required fields are filled and valid, and the user has agreed to terms. Use Vue's computed properties or watchers to manage button state.",

Check the order summary updates accurately with changes in user input.\n5. Ensure legal text links navigate to the correct documents and open in a new tab or modal.\n6. Validate that the confirmation button is disabled until all conditions are met, and becomes enabled when they are. Test edge cases for form validation.",
